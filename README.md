# Discrete-Opamp
 Discrete OpAmp for low voltage, low power audio applications.

# Specs
 The BC557- and BC547-transistors limit the opamp to 45V supply voltage. The OpAmp is intended for low-power amplification, the end-stage is limited to source and sink a maximum of 10mA. The OpAmp operates entirely in class A. The footprint is that of a standard single OpAmp in a DIP8-package.

 Simulation of the OpAmp indicates a THD of 0.000042% at 1kHz with 2Vpp into 100kOhm. This is probably unrealistic, but an indication of good operation. The open-loop gain resulted in around 108dB.
